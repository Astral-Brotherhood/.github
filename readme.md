The Astral Brotherhood is a private building group founded on the legacy of its predecessor, the Astral Order.


## History
The group was founded by Joey_Coconut and LordGalvatronMC on August 22nd, 2021. After the fall of all the major groups of the previous years such as Emperium, Vortex Coalition, and Infinity Incursion, the two friends expressed mutual interest in reviving the Astral Order, seeing it as a good opportunity to capitalize on the vacuum of builders seeking a new group. They invited builders from the aforementioned groups, as well as Shortbus Caliphate, Guardsmen, Builders Haven: Remastered and Drain Gang.
